        <h2>About Me</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        Hi, my name Luke Manyamazi, an IT professional with a wealth of
        experience in remote and onsite technical support. Over the years,
        I've cultivated a deep passion for technology and programming,
        continuously expanding my skill set. I have completed several key
        courses, including the CS50P Python
        Course, which strengthened my
        understanding of problem-solving with Python, as well as
        FreeCodeCamp
          Responsive Web Design Certification, which helped me
          master the basics of building accessible, user-friendly websites. I
          also completed Cloud Computing 101 on
          Coursera, broadening my knowledge
          of cloud infrastructure and services. These experiences have provided
          me with a solid foundation in both software development and web
          technologies.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Currently, I am a trainee at CodeYourFuture, where I am sharpening my
          coding skills through hands-on projects and collaborative learning. I
          am passionate about exploring new programming languages and
          technologies, and I look forward to applying my skills to build
          real-world solutions. Through my GitHub, I aim to share my learning
          journey and projects with the developer community, while continually
          improving and taking on new challenges.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          My ultimate goal is to become a full-stack software engineer, capable
          of developing robust, end-to-end systems, websites and applications
          that solve meaningful problems. I am committed to continuous learning
          and growth as I work towards this objective.
